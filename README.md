Facial Emotion Recognition with Full and Half Face (Eyes and Eyebrows) using (CNN)
This paper outlines the experiments done for emotion recognition using full face images and using half face images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
After doing all the five experiments of parameter tuning on the CNN model using full face images and all the four experiments of parameter tuning on the CNN model using half face images, we got different accuracies for each.
Using full face images on CNN model, using Adam optimizer, Epoch value 60, and Learning Rate of 0.0001, we got the highest accuracy using the full face images of 91% (0.9164) on the training set, 62% (0.6252) accuracy on the validation set, and 67% (0.6715) accuracy on the testing set.
Using half face images on CNN model, using Adam optimizer, Epoch value 60, and Learning Rate of 0.001, we got the highest accuracy using half face image of 63% (0.6339) on the training set, 41% (0.4182) accuracy on the validation set, and 43% (0.4319) accuracy on the testing set.
In this project, we altered the original dataset of full face images to half face images. If there will be a dataset available containing images of peopleâ€™s faces wearing a mask, we can get better accuracy
